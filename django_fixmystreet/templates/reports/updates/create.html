<h2>Nearly Done! Now check your email...</h2>

<p>The confirmation email may take a few minutes to arrive — please be patient.</p>

<p>If you use web-based email or have 'junk mail' filters, you may wish to check your bulk/spam mail folders: sometimes, our messages are marked that way.
You must now click the link in the email we've just sent you — if you do not, your update will not be activated.</p>

<p>(Don't worry — we'll hang on to your update while you're checking your email.)</p>
