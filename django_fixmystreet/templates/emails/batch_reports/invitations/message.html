<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I’m Jennifer Bell, Executive Director of VisibleGovernment.ca
(http://visiblegovernment.ca), a non-profit with a mission to promote
online tools for government transparency. As president of {{assoc}}, 
and a stakeholder in the quality of Ottawa’s roads and pathways, I’d 
like to introduce you to our new pilot project - FixMyStreet.ca:</p>

<p>http://fixmystreet.ca</p>

<p>Inspired by a similar site by in the UK by a group called MySociety,
FixMyStreet.ca allows you to report problems in your neighbourhood,
such as potholes, graffiti, missing streetlights, or dangerous
pathways. FixMyStreet.ca will post the problem on our website, and
email the report to Ottawa 311 on your behalf. You may also browse
through reports that other people have submitted, and subscribe to
ones you would like updates on.</p>

<p>We believe that making civic problem reports public and visible is a
valuable communications tool for both the City of Ottawa and its
citizens. Providing the ability to browse problems that have been
reported avoids having many people report the same issue individually.
Further, the site keeps public records of when reports were filed, and
when they were fixed, giving citizens access to richer information
about their community and municipal council.</p>

<p>Please help us launch our website by forwarding this message to people
in your community you think would be motivated to use fixmystreet.ca
to track problems in their neighbourhood.    If you have a community
newsletter, I could also provide you with more information for a story
or article to reach citizens in your neighbourhood.  If you have any
questions, I would be happy to speak with you about the site – my
number is 514-513-0475.</p>

<p>Jennifer Bell</p>
